    "# An Introduction to Conviction Voting\n",
    "\n",
    "Conviction Voting is an approach to organizing a communities preferences into discrete decisions in the management of that communities resources. Strictly speaking conviction voting is less like voting and more like signal processing. Framing the approach and the initial algorithm design was done by Michael Zargham and published in a short research proposal [Social Sensor Fusion](https://github.com/BlockScience/conviction/blob/master/social-sensorfusion.pdf). This work is based on a dynamic resource allocation algorithm presented in Dr. Zargham's PhD Thesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The work proceeded in collaboration with the Commons Stack, including expanding on the python implementation to makeup part of the Commons Simulator game. An implemention of Conviction Voting as a smart contract within the Aragon Framework was developed by 1Hive.org and is currently being used for community decision making for allocations of their community currency, Honey.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Word Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a group of people want to coordinate to make a collective decision. Social dynamics such as discussions, signaling, and even changing ones mind based on feedback from others input play an important role in these processes. While the actual decision making process involves a lot of informal processes, in order to be fair the ultimate decision making process still requires a set of formal rules that the community collecively agrees to, which serves to functionally channel a plurality of preferences into a discrete outcomes. In our case we are interested in a procedure which supports asynchronous interactions, an provides visibility into likely outcomes prior to their resolution to serve as a driver of good faith, debate and healthy forms of coalition building. Furthermore, participations should be able to show support for multiple initiatives, and to vary the level of support shown. Participants have a quantity of signaling power which may be fixed or variable, homogenous or heterogenous. For the purpose of this document, we'll focus on the case where the discrete decisions to be made are decisions to allocate funds from a shared funding pool towards projects of interest to the community.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Converting to a Math Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start taking these words and constructing a mathematical representation that supports a design that meets the description above. To start we need to define participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Participants\n",
    "Let $\\mathcal{A}$ be the set of participants. Consider a participant $a\\in \\mathcal{A}$. Any participant $a$ has some capacity to participate in the voting process through their token holdings $h[a]$. In a homogenous fixed token quantity system (like you might see in a democratic allocation of equal tokens per each participant), $h[a] = h$ for all $a\\in \\mathcal{A}$ where $h$ is a constant. The access control process managing how one becomes a participant determines the total supply of \"votes\" $S = \\sum_{a\\in \\mathcal{A}} = n\\cdot h$ where the number of participants is $n = |\\mathcal{A}|$. In a smart contract setting, the set $\\mathcal{A}$ is a set of addresses, and $h[a]$ is a quantity of tokens held by each address $a\\in \\mathcal{A}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposals & Shared Resources\n",
    "Next, we introduce the idea of proposals.  Consider a proposal $i\\in \\mathcal{C}$. Any proposal $i$ is associated with a request for resources $r[i]$. Those requested resources would be allocated from a constrained pool of communal resources currently totaling $R$. The pool of resources may become depleted because when a proposal $i$ passes the reserve is decremented by $R^+= R-r[i]$. Therefore it makes sense for us to consider what fraction of the shared resources are being request $\\mu_i = \\frac{r[i]}{R}$, which means that thre resource depletion from passing proposals can be bounded by requiring $\\mu_i < \\mu$ where $\\mu$ is a constant representing the maximum fraction of the shared resources which can be dispersed by any one proposal. In order for the system to be sustainable a source of new resources is required. In the case where $R$ is funding, new funding can come from revenues, donations, or in some DAO use cases minting tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Participants Preferences for Proposals\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the interesting information in this system is distributed amongst the participants and it manifests as preferences over the proposals. This can be visualized as a matrix $W\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times m}$, with participants holding randomized affinities from -1 to +1 over all proposals.\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/Rk2BYKd.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "These private hidden signals drive discussions and voting actions. Each participant individually decides how to allocate their votes across the available proposals. Participant $a$ supports proposal $i$ by setting $x[a,i]>0$ but they are limited by their total token holdings $\\sum_{k\\in \\mathcal{C}} x[a,k] \\le h[a]$.  Assuming each participant chooses a subset of the proposals to support, a support graph is formed.\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/KRh8tKn.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Aggregating Information\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to break out of the synchronous ad hoc voting model, a dynamical systems model of this system is introduced, which is explored further below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Participants Allocate Voting Power\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/DZRDwk6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above diagram, we examine the participant view. Participant $a$ with holdings $h$ at time $t$ supports proposals $i$ and $j$ with $x$ conviction. The sum of all conviction asserted by participant $a$ is between 0 and the total holdings of participant $a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### System Accounts Proposal Conviction\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/euAei5R.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above diagram, we examine the proposal view. Proposal $j$ with total conviction $y$ at time $t$ is supported by participants $a$, $b$ and $c$ with $x$ conviction. The total conviction $y$ at time $t+1$ is equal to the total conviction at time $t$ decremented by an exponential decay $\\\\alpha$ plus the sum of all conviction from $k$ agents in time step $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Alpha\n",
    "Below are some graphs used to demonstrate, play with, and understand the shapes and choices for the $\\\\alpha$ parameter, which regulates the half life decay rate of the agent preference conviction growth and decay.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Converting Signals to Discrete Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "Conviction can be considered like a fluctuating kinetic energy, with the Trigger function acting as a required activation energy for proposals to pass. This is the mechanism by which a continuous community preference turns into a discrete action event: passing a proposal.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the cadCAD simulation [methodology](https://community.cadcad.org/t/differential-specification-syntax-key/31), we operate on four layers: **Policies, Mechanisms, States**, and **Metrics**. Information flows do not have explicit feedback loop unless noted. **Policies** determine the inputs into the system dynamics, and can come from user input, observations from the exogenous environment, or algorithms. **Mechanisms** are functions that take the policy decisions and update the States to reflect the policy level changes. **States** are variables that represent the system quantities at the given point in time, and **Metrics** are computed from state variables to assess the health of the system. Metrics can often be thought of as KPIs, or Key Performance Indicators. \n",

    "The way to think of cadCAD modeling is analogous to machine learning pipelines which normally consist of multiple steps when training and running a deployed model. There is preprocessing, which includes segregating features between continuous and categorical, transforming or imputing data, and then instantiating, training, and running a machine learning model with specified hyperparameters. cadCAD modeling can be thought of in the same way as states, roughly translating into features, are fed into pipelines that have built-in logic to direct traffic between different mechanisms, such as scaling and imputation. Accuracy scores, ROC, etc. are analogous to the metrics that can be configured on a cadCAD model, specifying how well a given model is doing in meeting its objectives. The parameter sweeping capability of cadCAD can be thought of as a grid search, or way to find the optimal hyperparameters for a system by running through alternative scenarios. A/B style testing that cadCAD enables is used in the same way machine learning models are A/B tested, except out of the box, in providing a side by side comparison of muliple different models to compare and contrast performance. Utilizing the field of Systems Identification, dynamical systems models can be used to \"online learn\" by providing a feedback loop to generative system mechanisms. \n",
