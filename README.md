# Aragon_Conviction_Voting

[Conviction Voting](https://medium.com/giveth/conviction-voting-a-novel-continuous-decision-making-alternative-to-governance-aa746cfb9475) is a novel decision making process where votes express their preference for which proposals they would like to see approved in a continuous rather than discrete way. The longer the community keeps a preference on an individual proposal, the “stronger” the proposal conviction becomes. In the conviction voting model, a graph structure is used to record the the introduction and removal of participants, candidates, proposals, and their outcomes.

## What is cadCAD?
cadCAD (complex adaptive dynamics Computer-Aided Design) is a python based modeling framework for research, validation, and Computer Aided Design of complex systems. Given a model of a complex system, cadCAD can simulate the impact that a set of actions might have on it. This helps users make informed, rigorously tested decisions on how best to modify or interact with the system in order to achieve their goals. cadCAD supports different system modeling approaches and can be easily integrated with common empirical data science workflows. Monte Carlo methods, A/B testing and parameter sweeping features are natively supported and optimized for.


## Reproducibility
In order to reperform this code, we recommend the researcher use the following link to download https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual to download Python 3.7.To install the specific version of cadCAD this repository was built with, run the following code:
pip install cadCAD==0.4.17

Then run cd Aragon_Conviction_Voting to enter the repository. Finally, run jupyter notebook to open a notebook server to run the various notebooks in this repository.
